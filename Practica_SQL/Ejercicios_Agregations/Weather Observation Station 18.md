# Consider P1(a,b) and P2(c,d) to be two points on a 2D plane.

 
 
a- happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).

b- happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).

c- happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).

d- happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).

Query the Manhattan Distance between points  and  and round it to a scale of  decimal places.

Input Format

The STATION table is described as follows:

where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

## Soluci√≥n

SELECT ROUND((MAX(lat_n) - MIN(lat_n)) + (MAX(long_w) - MIN(long_w)), 4)
FROM station;
